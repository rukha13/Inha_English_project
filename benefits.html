                Education and learning methods have changed and made them more
                engaging and helpful for the students. Students do not need to
                attend physically in the classroom, they present the class
                online. Because of online education, the gap between the lower
                and upper countries has vanished. Moreover, the cost of online
                learning is more cost-effective than physical attendance. For
                that, anyone can afford it easily. If you take a class
                physically and miss any important part of the lecture you can't
                watch or listen again. However, whereas you take a course or
                class which has the option of recording and you miss any part
                then you can easily replay it. That is the main advantage of
                technology.
